## Gherkin support

This plugin supports gherkin support.

If you use `@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor` plugin
then also there would be tags support available.

Special tags will add meta info to report.

Example(in this example it will add several links to test):
```gherkin
  @issue("ABC-001")
  @tms("ABC-002")
  @tms("ABC-003","Description__of__ticket")
  Scenario: should have several tms tags
    Given I log message "test"
```

Special tags are the same as allure interface items, see [interface](./interface.md)
